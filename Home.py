It is an extension of the Human Development Index (HDI) and focuses on three key dimensions: health, education, and income. In the GDI, these dimensions are assessed separately for males and females, allowing for a comparison of gender-based development gaps. Health indicators typically include life expectancy at birth for both genders. Education indicators encompass literacy rates and enrollment in primary, secondary, and tertiary education for both males and females. The income component typically examines income levels and workforce participation for both genders.')
