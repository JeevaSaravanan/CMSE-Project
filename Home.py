The ongoing COVID-19 pandemic, global environmental crises, and rising inequalities have fueled this uncertainty, impeding human development and creating a sense of insecurity. For the first time, the global Human Development Index (HDI) has declined for two consecutive years, while democratic backsliding has worsened. Despite the perils of these new uncertainties, there is promise in reimagining our future, adapting our institutions, and crafting new narratives. This presents an opportunity to thrive in a rapidly changing world.')

    - This app is worthy of completion because it addresses a critical issue ‚Äì gender disparities in human development ‚Äì which has real-world implications for policymaking and social progress. By analyzing the GDI dataset and creating an accessible web app, we can contribute to the ongoing efforts to promote gender equality and improve human development outcomes globally.

    - **THE PATH TO GENDER EQUALITY:** This expands the measures for women and girls to exercise their potential, their opportunities and the choices available to them. Policies that seek to further empower women and girls and achieve gender parity require robust data and measures that are comparable across countries and based on a sound methodology. While some such measures are available, the picture has been incomplete.
